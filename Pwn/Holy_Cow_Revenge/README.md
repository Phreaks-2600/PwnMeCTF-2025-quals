# Holy Cow Revenge

## Description 
I'm really concerned about my privacy, so I run under a patched version of chromium. 
During a free security audit I got from a ctf (https://hackropole.fr/fr/challenges/pwn/fcsc2024-pwn-holy-cow/) I saw that everyone was exploiting the v8 engine through an old technique, but now that I updated the codebase, it shouldn't be a problem anymore :^)
