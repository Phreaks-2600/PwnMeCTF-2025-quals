            <div class="message user1">So, Tony, have you seen what they're offering to the VIPs here? It's clean, isn't it?</div>
            <div class="message user2">Hey, Vinnie, yeah, clean... But let's not forget why we're here. We're not here for the snacks.</div>
            <div class="message user1">Relax, relax. I've spotted a few targets with well filled wallet hanging around. We could quietly make them spit some cash.</div>
            <div class="message user2">Watch out, there's always ears hanging around. And cameras. We don't want to be spotted.</div>
            <div class="message user1">Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I've got a little set of rigged cards in my pocket. They won't any differences.</div>
            <div class="message user2">And then what do we do with the money?</div>
            <div class="message user1">We launder it, as usual. It's a good thing they don't have their hands on {{ flag }}, otherwise we'd be screwed.</div>
            <div class="message user2">{{ flag }}? What's ts all about? You'd better not be putting me in trouble with your bs.</div>
            <div class="message user1">It's nothing, it's nothing. Forget about it. Just focus on the game. Let's make some money and get out of here.</div>
            <div class="message user2">Yeah... I don't like this. But we're already here. So we might as well get the job done. But no waves, understand?</div>
